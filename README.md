# All-In-One Kubernetes tools (kubectl, helm, iam-authenticator, eksctl, kubeseal, etc)

kubernetes docker images with necessary tools 

### Notes

(1) For AWS EKS users, not all versions are supported yet. [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks) maintains [special kubernetes versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html) to its managed service. Do remember to choice the proper version for EKS only.

(2) There is no `latest` tag for this image

(3) If you need more tools to be added, raise tickets in issues.

# kubectl versions

You should check in [kubernetes versions](https://kubernetes.io/releases/), it lists the kubectl latest minor versions and used as image tags.

# Involve with developing and testing

If you want to build these images by yourself, please follow below commands.

```
export REBUILD=true
# comment the line in file "build.sh" to stop image push:  docker push ${image}:${tag}
bash ./build.sh
```

If you are building on MacOS, install dependencies with:

```
brew install jq grep html2text
```
